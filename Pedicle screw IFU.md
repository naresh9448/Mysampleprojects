## 3. Intended Use

The SpineFix™ Pedicle Screw System is intended to provide immobilization and stabilization of spinal segments as an adjunct to fusion in the treatment of acute and chronic instabilities or deformities of the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spine.

---

## 4. Indications

- Degenerative disc disease (DDD)
- Spondylolisthesis
- Trauma (e.g., fracture or dislocation)
- Spinal stenosis
- Curvatures (e.g., scoliosis, kyphosis)
- Tumor
- Pseudoarthrosis
- Failed previous fusion

---

## 5. Contraindications

- Active infection at the surgical site
- Allergy or sensitivity to implant materials
- Severe osteoporosis or other bone conditions that may compromise fixation
- Inadequate bone stock for screw fixation
- Spinal instability not amenable to internal fixation

---

## 6. Warnings and Precautions

- Only surgeons trained in spinal fixation techniques should use this system.
- Do not reuse or re-sterilize single-use implants.
- Inspect all components for damage prior to use.
- Do not use if packaging is damaged or opened.
- Ensure proper alignment and secure fixation to avoid implant migration or loosening.
- Use only SpineFix™ system components; do not mix with other manufacturers’ devices.

## 8. Surgical Procedure (Summary)

> **Note:** Refer to the detailed surgical technique manual for comprehensive instructions.

1. **Patient Positioning:** Place the patient in the prone position on a radiolucent table.
2. **Exposure:** Perform a midline incision and expose the posterior elements of the affected vertebrae.
3. **Pedicle Preparation:** Identify and prepare the pedicle entry points using an awl and pedicle probe.
4. **Screw Insertion:** Insert the appropriate size SpineFix™ pedicle screws into the prepared pedicles under fluoroscopic guidance.
5. **Rod Contouring and Placement:** Contour the rod as needed and insert into the screw heads.
6. **Set Screw Application:** Secure the rod by tightening the set screws to the recommended torque.
7. **Final Tightening:** Confirm alignment and perform final tightening of all connections.
8. **Closure:** Irrigate the wound and close in layers per standard surgical practice.

## 9. Postoperative Care

- Monitor for signs of infection, implant migration, or neurological compromise.
- Advise patient on activity restrictions and follow-up schedule.
- Imaging may be required to confirm implant position.

---

## 10. Removal

Implant removal is at the discretion of the surgeon if the device is no longer required for stabilization or if complications arise.

---

## 11. Adverse Events

Potential adverse events include, but are not limited to:

- Infection
- Implant loosening or breakage
- Nerve injury
- Vascular injury
- Non-union or delayed union
- Allergic reaction

---

## 12. Storage

- Store in a clean, dry environment at room temperature.
- Protect from excessive moisture and direct sunlight.
