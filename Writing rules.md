# 1. Language Guidelines

## 1.1 Text Types

- Do not combine sections with different communication purposes (e.g., requirements, warnings, descriptions).

### 1.1.1 Action Chapters

- Chapter titles that require action must include:
  - A verb describing the required action.
  - A noun for the object being acted upon, without articles.
  - **Example:** Connect compressed air supply, Lift machine stands with crane.
- The verb may start the heading.
  - **Example:** Transporting with a forklift.

### 1.1.2 Main Chapters

- General action chapters use only a noun or gerund to describe the activity.
  - **Example:** Connection, Transport.

### 1.1.3 Descriptive Chapters

- Descriptive chapter headings:
  - Do not use verbs.
  - Use a noun for the described object, without articles.
  - **Example:** Intended use, Dimensions and weight, Process.

### 1.1.4 Headings in “Connecting” Chapters

- For single-component products, headings answer “What is to be connected?”
  - **Example:** Connecting the ground.
- For multi-component products, headings answer “What is connected to what?”
  - **Example:** Connecting the ground to the servo controller.
- For optional components, use “optional” before the component.
  - **Example:** Connecting the optional control panel.
- For components that can be connected to various parts, use “optionally” before the selectable component.
  - **Example:** Connecting the feed system optionally to the control unit.

#### 1.1.4.1 Heading Patterns

- The main chapter “Connection” covers all connection-related actions.
- Sub-chapter headings clarify:
  - What needs to be done? (e.g., Observe the connection sequence)
  - What is connected to where? (e.g., Connecting the power supply to the control unit)
- Specify “where to connect” only if necessary to distinguish between options.
- The “Connection” chapter always includes:
  - About connecting (descriptive, not action-based)
  - Observe the connection sequence (action-based, specifies order if needed)

##### 1.1.4.1.1 Grouping and Hierarchy

- Sub-chapter headings are organized by function.
- For optional components or connections, use:
  - “Connecting the optional (XY)”
  - “Optionally connecting X to Y”
- If tasks can be grouped logically, use a third-level structure.
  - **Example:**
    - Connection
      - Connecting the feed system
        - Connecting the feed system to the Safety Air Box
        - Optionally connecting the feed system to the control unit

## 1.2 Continuous Text

- Avoid nominalization (turning verbs into nouns).
- Use short, clear sentences.
- Minimize modal verbs and the subjunctive.
- Write in active voice; avoid passive constructions.
  - **Incorrect:** The control unit is typically operated outside the robot booth.
  - **Correct:** The control unit is typically outside the robot cell. It has the following functions.
- Do not use “serve to” constructions.
  - **Incorrect:** The safety fence serves to protect the operator.
  - **Correct:** The safety fence protects the operator.

## 1.3 Lists

- Use lists for multiple items.
- Use lists for four or more points.

## 1.4 Captions

- Place captions under product images, diagrams, and non-pictograph graphics.
- Captions must include the full product/component name and abbreviation.
- For general figures, end the caption with “example.”
  - **Example:** The system’s emergency stop button (example).

## 1.5 Calls to Action

- Write instructions in the imperative and active voice.
  - **Incorrect:** The software is to be installed.
  - **Correct:** Install the software.
- Address the user directly.
- If only certain users may perform an action, specify at the start.
  - **Incorrect:** Before performance of these tasks, expert training is required.
  - **Correct:** Only an expert can perform these tasks.

### 1.5.1 Nominalization

- Use nominalization in legend charts or to clarify hazards in warnings.

## 1.6 Tools and Replacement Parts

- List required tools before the action sequence.
- List necessary replacement parts as prerequisites.

## 1.7 Conditions

- Use the “if...then” structure for conditional sentences.
  - **Example:** If you are using the auto-start function, then connect the 8-pin plug...

## 1.8 Purpose Statements

- Purpose statements should be in the same sentence or paragraph as the action.
- If further explanation is needed, follow with a new sentence using “to do this” or “for this purpose.”

## 1.9 Tables

### 1.9.1 Legend Charts

- Use three columns: Item, Name, Description.
- Use sentence fragments, not full sentences.

### 1.9.2 Glossary Tables

- Use “Term” and “Definition” columns.
- Definitions are full sentences.

## 1.10 Safety Instructions and Warnings

### 1.10.1 Warnings

- Use both pre-placed and integrated warnings.
- Follow the SAFE principle (Severity, Type, Consequence, Evasion).
- Use appropriate signal words per ANSI Z535.6.
- Write consequences as continuous text; measures as imperative actions.

### 1.10.2 Safety Instructions

- Describe residual risks not tied to specific actions.
- Structure like warnings but do not format as warnings.

## 1.11 Parentheses

- Avoid parentheses except for abbreviations and references.

## 1.12 Hyphens and Dashes

- Use hyphens for compound words, EM-dashes for clauses, EN-dashes for ranges and operators.

## 1.13 Forward Slash

- Avoid slashes in text; use “or” instead.
- No spaces in fractions.

## 1.14 Spaces

- Use non-breaking spaces between numbers and units.

## 1.15 Abbreviations

- Use non-breaking spaces in abbreviations.
- Product abbreviations must have a space between letters and numbers.
